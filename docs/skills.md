# ncode skills

A skill is a reusable instruction set written as a single
`SKILL.md` file with a YAML frontmatter header. Unless a skill disables
model invocation, ncode discovers it at startup and surfaces it to the model
in two ways:

1. The system prompt gains a short manifest:
   `Available skills: ... - code-review — Run a self-review pass...`
2. A built-in `skill` tool lets the model load any one skill's full
   body on demand.

The on-demand-load model keeps token usage cheap: only the manifest
goes into every request; the body is fetched as a tool result the
one or two turns the model actually needs it.

## Anatomy

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Run a thorough self-review pass on a recent change.
allowed-tools: [read, bash]
permissions:
  bash: ["git diff*", "git log*"]
---

# Code review

When asked to review code, ...
```

### Frontmatter fields

| field | required | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | optional | skill identifier; defaults to the directory name |
| `description` | required | one-line summary shown in the system prompt |
| `disable-model-invocation` | optional | when `true`, hide the skill from the model's startup manifest; invoke it explicitly with `/skill:<name>` |
| `allowed-tools` | optional | list of tool names the skill is meant to use; informational |
| `permissions` | optional | per-tool patterns; informational |

`allowed-tools` and `permissions` are **parsed but not enforced** in
this version. They appear in the rendered skill body so the model can
see them and self-regulate. Future versions may enforce.

The body (everything after the second `---`) is plain markdown.
There's no template engine; the model sees what you write.

## Discovery

ncode looks in these directories, in priority order, and registers the
first `SKILL.md` it finds for each unique name:

| location | scope |
|---|---|
| `./.ncode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | project (native) |
| `$NCODE_HOME/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | global (native) |
| `./.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | project (claude-compat) |
| `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | global (claude-compat) |
| `./.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | project (agent-compat) |
| `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | global (agent-compat) |

The compat paths are deliberate: a `SKILL.md` written for an existing
skill ecosystem works in ncode unchanged. Drop your existing
`.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directories into a project and
ncode will pick them up.

When `XDG_STATE_HOME` is set on any platform, `$NCODE_HOME` defaults to
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/ncode`. Otherwise it defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/ncode/`
on macOS, `~/.local/state/ncode` on Linux, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ncode` on Windows.

## Inspecting installed skills

In ncode, run `/skills`. A picker lists every discovered skill with its
description and source path. Press enter on a row to view the full
body inline. Press esc to go back.

## Invoking skills

For normal skills, the system prompt tells the model the skill names and
short descriptions. When a request matches, the model calls the `skill` tool
to load the full instructions on demand.

To force a specific skill, invoke it as a slash command. Typing `/skill:` opens a filtered list of discovered user skills. Use the arrow keys to select one, `tab` to complete its name, or `enter` to invoke the highlighted skill.

```text
/skill:code-review
/skill:code-review focus on security issues
```

ncode expands the command into a user message containing the complete skill
body, its directory for resolving relative references, and any text following
the command as the request. This bypasses model-side skill selection.

Set `disable-model-invocation: true` in a skill's frontmatter when it should
only run after explicit user invocation. The skill remains visible in
`/skills` and available through `/skill:<name>`, but its name and description
are omitted from the model's startup context.

## Writing good skills

- **Be procedural.** Number steps. Tell the model what to do in what
  order. Skills are habits, not knowledge dumps.
- **Be precise about boundaries.** "Stop after step 4" is more
  effective than "don't go too far".
- **Trim aggressively.** A 200-line skill bloats every turn the
  model uses it. Aim for 20–80 lines.
- **One skill per behaviour.** Don't pack three workflows into one
  SKILL.md; the model picks one path. Two separate skills work better.
- **Lead with the trigger.** First paragraph should make it
  obvious *when* to use the skill so the model self-selects correctly.

## Examples

See `examples/skills/` for two starter skills:

- `code-review/` — self-review pass on a recent diff
- `test-fix/` — diagnose + minimally fix a failing test

## Comparison to other discovery layouts

| ecosystem | path | ncode reads it? |
|---|---|---|
| (native) | `.ncode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | yes |
| (claude-style) | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | yes |
| (agent-style) | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | yes |

Cross-pollination is intentional: pick whichever convention you're
already using and ncode tags along.
